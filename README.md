## EurÃªka

### Info

Where I expect to be able to convert a frequency to a arbitrary 
musical scale. At first try to be as general as possible, but focus
on tonalities with twelve tones. 

Basically all thing related to musical theory should go here.

### Build

#### State:

In progress, but not quite there yet. It will need to extern testing since
most of this will be template classes.

#### Dependencies:

* Cantina common (submodule)
	
### To do

#### Features 

- [ ] Think of the right architecture to convert between frequency and scales.
- [ ] Rework MusicalScales from there.
